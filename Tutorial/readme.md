# Structure of Tutorials

#### Based on the great Paul McWhorter’s video series:

All tutorials are inside the folder `tutorial`.  
Each lesson has its own folder, and each sketch is in its **own folder**, as per Arduino’s requirements.

Example folder structure:

Tutorial/
│
├─ 00_sketches/
│   └─ 00_pin13/      ← contains 00_pin13.ino
│
├─ 01_sketches/
│   └─ 01_XXX/        ← contains 01_XXX.ino
│
...

Local Note: 'ard' will move you into the Tutorial folder
